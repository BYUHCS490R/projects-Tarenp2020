        <p>I am picking to write about a comic artist that I have liked for a while who goes by <strong>Picolo</strong> on Instagram. I have a couple reasons why I love his art. I think that he is amazing at drawing everyday moments and making them seem so special and fun. He captures the relationship between his characters well. I also love his coloring style. He is able to use muted tones to then get specifics to pop, which I just love. I feel like he can capture the magic of any moment in your life, even something as simple as putting on your shoes.</p>

            <dt>Teen Titans</dt>
            <dd>He is always drawing characters from a popular cartoon called Teen Titans. They are 5 super heros that team up with the head being Robin, Batmans sidekick. However, Batman is not in the show.</dd>
            <dt>Brazil</dt>
            <dd>He is from Brazil!</dd>
            <dt>Teen Titans: Together</dt>
            <dd> This is a book he was able to do the illustrations for and is now being sold in Barnes & Noble.</dd>
