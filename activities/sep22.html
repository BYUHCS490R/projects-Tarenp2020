        <h2>Questions and answers</h2>

        <p><strong>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</strong><br>
        See above links<br><br>

        <strong>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</strong><br>
        The root is where the website starts the ralationship is that it shows the path to the file. The names thaat we give thing will create the path taken to pull them up. It becomes your homepage!<br><br>

        <strong>What is a default document?</strong><br>
        Every folder can have one, its called index.html and it will automatically pull up that page when you go to that folder.<br><br>
    
        <strong>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</strong><br>
        An absolute link is when a link(normally external) has the full path inputed in. A relative link is when an internal link is given and only the file name is given, no full link needed.

        <ol>
            <li>include filder name to go into a folder</li>
            <li>include 2 dots in front to go back a folder</li>
            <li>Start over with a slash to go back to the root (doesn;t work for this class)</li>
