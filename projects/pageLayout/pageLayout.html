            <p>I love playing the game animal crossing. Everything is made to look so cute and the charaters you interact with are no exception. I wanted to show off a few of my favorits just becuase not only is their looks super cute but they also where given cute personalitys so I enjoy interacting with them.</p>

            

            <p>I am going to be choosing from Animal Crossign New Horrizzens becasue that is the Animal Crossing game I have played the most. I think most of the characters are fun to look at but becuase they can have such extream styles and attitudes its easy to start to find favorits.</p>
