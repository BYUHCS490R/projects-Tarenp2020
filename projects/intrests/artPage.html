        <h2>Link Explanations</h2>
        <p>A relative link is a link that goes to another page that is in the same domain as the current page. Here is an example: <a href="../profilePage.html">a relative link to my profile page</a><br> An abolute link goes to a page that is out of the pages domain and requires the whole link to be embeded in the code. Here is an example: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_picolo/?hl=en"> an absolute link to one of my favorite artis's instagram</a></p><br>

        <h2>Taren's Art Rant</h2>
        <p id="start">I have always <span>loved</span> to draw and create all kinds of art. Typically I will sketch but when I was younger I had lots of experiences and opportunities to take potery classes so I also <span>love to work with clay</span> to create bowls, tea pots, and other silly nicknacks.</p>

        <p id="start">I am not a profesional artist by all means so I get embaressed sharing my art with people. I do it for fun and I am still trying to create an art style I like. My favorite thing to draw is faces. I have always <span>loved</span> to draw them. It's so satisfity to get a faace right. I hope one day to be able to satisfyingly draw my future family's portrait. </p>


        <h2>CSS Colors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>What color did you choose to emphasize text? (this text should be that color).</span></li>
            <li>What color did you choose to de-emphasize text? (this text should be that color).</li>
            <li>How did you choose your colors? Did you use a tool online to help you find colors?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I just picked a pretty dark red color I liked from the VS Code eyedroper and then chose other colors I felt matched with that dark red using the same everyday tool.</p>
