        Hello its nice to meet you! A little about me is I like <em>cats, video games, art, &amp; sports</em>. I have also grown up <u>singing in choirs, playing saxaphone, and piano.</u>

        I also speak Japanese. I studied it in highschool, served my mission there, and now have a minnor in it. I try to speak and think in Japanese everyday in hopes of improving it to the point where <strong>I can work in Japan.</strong>
