    <header>
    <h1>Header</h1>
    <p> A header holds the title. Most important key words</p>

    </header>

    <nav>
    <p> you should put links here. I think it should go in the header, but doesnt have too. Its better for nav to link to the same website but you can put any link you want</p>
    </nav>


    <main>
    <p> this is what only this page holds and what makes it important/needed</p>
    </main>
